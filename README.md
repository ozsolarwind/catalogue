# catalogue
A simple catalogue of "things"

This application is a prototype of a catalogue for holding information about "things". It attempts to be as unspecific as possible to improve its usefulness. The program uses catalogues which are stored in sqlite3 databases. sqlite3 databases are single files and require no additional programs or packages.
